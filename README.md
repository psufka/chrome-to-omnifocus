# Save to OmniFocus Chrome Extension by Paul Sufka

## Version 1.0.1

A Chrome extension by Paul Sufka to save the current tab, selected text, or link as a task in OmniFocus. Built with Manifest V3 for compatibility with modern Chrome versions.

## Features
- **Toolbar Button**: Saves the current tab's title as the task name and URL as the note, or uses selected text if available.
- Uses OmniFocus's URL scheme (`omnifocus:///add`) to create tasks automatically.

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository. (On the web, you can click the green <> Code" button and download an entire .zip file). Place the unzipped files in the directory of your choosing (e.g. ~/Documents/chrome-to-omnifocus/)
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" (top right).
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing the extension files.
5. The extension icon should appear in your toolbar. _You may want to pin it for easier access._
6. Before first use, either restart your browser, or reload the tab you want to save.

## Usage
- Click the toolbar icon to save the current tab or selected text to OmniFocus.
- You may want to pin the icon to your toolbar for easier access.
